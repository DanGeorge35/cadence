Function Component (function Form() {...}):
These are also known as functional components.
They are simple JavaScript functions that take props as an argument and return JSX (the component's UI).
Functional components are typically used for "presentational" components that don't have their own state or lifecycle 
methods.
With the introduction of React Hooks, you can now use state and lifecycle features in functional components using 
hooks like useState and useEffect.

function Form() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* JSX representing the component's UI */}
    </div>
  );
}


Class Component (class Form extends Component { ... }):

Class components are traditional React components that extend the Component class from the React library.
They are used for more complex components that need to manage their own state, use lifecycle methods, and interact with props and state.
While class components have been widely used in older versions of React, with the introduction of React Hooks,
 many class component features can now be replicated in functional components.
Here's an example of a class component:

import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Form extends Component {
  // Component state and lifecycle methods can be defined here
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {/* JSX representing the component's UI */}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
