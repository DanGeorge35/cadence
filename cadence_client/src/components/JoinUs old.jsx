                  Imagine owning a shortlet apartment like ours and enjoying
                  steady returns from regular bookings. At Cadence, we can guide
                  you through setting up your own shortlet apartment for FREE.
                  Alternatively, if you&apos;re not ready to invest in setting
                  up your own apartment, you can invest with Cadence and earn 5%
                  monthly returns on your investment.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Our apartments enjoy 15 to 25 nights booked every month,
                  ensuring our investors earn consistently from our bookings. As
                  a Cadence investor, you will also benefit from up to a 20%
                  discount on your bookings, enhancing your stay even more.
                  Additionally, we offer a 5% referral commission when you refer
                  friends and family to invest with us.
